# Structure of RO1 letter of support

1.  Opening Statement

``` text
I am very happy to confirm my collaboration and support for your NIH RO1 application entitled “XXX”.
```

2.  Intro to role and expertise

``` text
I lead the Data Science Core Facility at XXX. Our staff has extensive experience processing and interpreting bulk and single-cell transcriptomic and genomic data.
```

3.  Specifics of Project

``` text
In this grant application, you have proposed to YYYYY, and we are well equipped to assist you with that work. We have substantial expertise in biostatistics and will support you on all aspects of study design, data analysis and interpretation for your research, manuscripts, and future grant applications.
```

4.  Highlight Additional Resources

``` text
In addition, we have access to MetaCore, an analytical software package that can be used by investigators like yourself to functionally interpret lists of genes. Our core is committed to providing you with the technical, analytical, and bioinformatics resources necessary for your research.
```

5.  Describe Available Infrastructure

``` text
We also help facilitate usage of the KI computational infrastructure so that investigators are able to process and securely store their data. The Linux compute cluster that is available to MIT Cancer Center researchers is equipped with necessary software and we make extensive use of nextflow, conda and containerized computing approaches to ensure that all necessary software is available to researchers in a robust and reproducible environment.
```

6.  Describe Compliance and Public Data Sharing Capacity

``` text
We are also equipped to assist in preparing all sequencing datasets generated through this grant application for public access as part of this proposal. We will support these efforts by preparing demultiplexed FASTQ files for upload to the NCBI Gene Expression (GEO) data repository and Sequence Read Archive (SRA), along with associated metadata manifest files and data analysis pipelines
```

7.  Closing

``` text
I look forward to providing you with the technical, biostatistical and bioinformatics support needed to conduct this research and accelerate the discovery of novel agents to impact cancer.
```
